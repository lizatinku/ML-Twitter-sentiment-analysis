# ML-Twitter-sentimentanalysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression. I utilized the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle, which consists of tweets labeled as positive or negative sentiments.

## Project Overview
The main goals of this project are:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the tweet data using Python, NLTK, and regular expressions.
Logistic Regression Model: Training a logistic regression model to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on both training and test datasets.


## Dataset
The Sentiment140 dataset contains 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiments as follows:

0: Negative sentiment
1: Positive sentiment

## Model Performance
Accuracy on Training Set: 99%
Accuracy on Test Set: 51%
